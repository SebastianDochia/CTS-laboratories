1. Code structure and naming conventions

- the package name is too generic, where is the module name?
- the class name is saying nothing
- the function name is too generic
- the function arguments names are not ok
- t and s must have meaningful names (S-a zis fix mai sus?)

2. Implementation
- too many 'magic numbers' (hard coded values)
- is t limited to {1, 2, 3, 4} or it can be bigger?
- no validations for t,  s and perioada

3. Single Responsibility & KISS (Keep it simple and stupid)
