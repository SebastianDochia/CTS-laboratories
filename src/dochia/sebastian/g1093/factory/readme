Mycelium - a collaborative IDE for teaching

When a user logs in his profile is stored in the application state. That account can either be a student account or a professor account.

Pro:    - Hides the implementation
        - It maks it easy to modify the implementation without impact over the rest of the application

Con:    - Makes code more difficult to read
        - Might further complicate the app down the line if another abstraction layer is added
